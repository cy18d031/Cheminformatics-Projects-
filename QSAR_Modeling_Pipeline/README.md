# QSAR_Modeling_Pipeline

**Colab-ready — RDKit + scikit-learn**
---

This repository hosts a complete **QSAR (Quantitative Structure–Activity Relationship)** modeling pipeline implemented in Python. It is designed to showcase high-level computational chemistry and cheminformatics skills, including dataset curation, descriptor generation, machine learning model training, evaluation, and prediction.

The pipeline is optimized for reproducibility, modularity, and professional presentation — ideal for portfolio demonstrations to recruiters or collaborators.

## Key Features
1. Fetch bioactivity data (IC50) from ChEMBL for a protein target (default: EGFR).  
2. Compute RDKit molecular descriptors for compounds.  
3. Train a **Random Forest Regression** model to predict pIC50.  
4. Evaluate with **R²** and **RMSE** metrics.  
5. Visualize predicted vs actual activity values.
